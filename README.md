## Description

Intellect365 is an automated trading software that aims to execute trading strategies based on predefined conditions. The EA is initialized with specific parameters and performs optimization and testing since 2012 on real ticks before starting the trading process.

The global variable `g_FirstTradeDelay` is set to 7, representing the number of days before opening the first trade. 

The EA consists of the following key functions:

### OnInit

This function is called during the initialization of the EA. It sets the trading parameters such as commission and spread to 0. It then calls the `OptimizeAndTestSince2012` function to perform optimization and testing on real ticks since 2012. If the optimization and testing fail, an error message is printed, and the initialization process is considered failed. Finally, it schedules the first trade by setting a timer using the `EventSetTimer` function.

### OnDeinit

This function is called during the deinitialization of the EA. It is responsible for cleaning up any resources before terminating the EA. In this case, it calls the `EventKillTimer` function to stop the timer.

### OnTick

This function is called on every tick. It checks if it's time to open a trade by calling the `EventTriggered` function. If the condition is met, it executes the trading strategies by calling the `ExecuteTradingStrategies` function. After executing the strategies, it stops further trades by calling the `EventKillTimer` function.

### OptimizeAndTestSince2012

This function implements the logic for optimizing and testing the software since 2012 on real ticks. The details of the optimization and testing process are not provided in the code, but it returns true if the optimization and testing are successful.

### EventTriggered

This function checks if it's time to open a trade based on certain conditions. The specific conditions are not provided in the code, but it returns true if it's time to open a trade.

### ExecuteTradingStrategies

This function implements the logic for executing the trading strategies. The details of the trading strategies are not provided in the code, but this is where the actual trading actions would be performed.
